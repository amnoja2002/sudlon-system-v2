  🌱 Factories & Seeders Rule — Use Laravel model factories and seeders to
  generate test data for development, Tinker, and testing.
  ✅ Do:
    - Use model factories to create fake data quickly (e.g., Task::factory()->count(10)->create()).
    - Store factories in database/factories and customize fields with Faker.
    - Use seeders in database/seeders to populate required baseline data.
    - Use DatabaseSeeder to combine multiple seeders for convenience.
    - Run `php artisan db:seed` or `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` to refresh test data.
    - Use seeders for roles, permissions, demo users, or lookup tables.
    - Use factories with PHPUnit/Pest tests for repeatable test setups.
  ❌ Don’t:
    - Hardcode large datasets in controllers or migrations.
    - Manually insert test data in Tinker every time.
    - Use production DB for experiments — keep this to dev/test only.
Examples:
  # Using a factory in Tinker
  App\Models\Task::factory()->count(5)->create();

  # Creating a user with override fields
  App\Models\User::factory()->create([
    'email' => 'test@example.com',
    'is_admin' => true,
  ]);

  # Running seeders
  php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
globs:
  - "database/factories/**/*.php"
  - "database/seeders/**/*.php"
  - "app/Models/**/*.php"
