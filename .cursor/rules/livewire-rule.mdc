  🔴 Livewire Rule
  ✅ Do:
    - Use for forms, real-time validation, search, pagination, task updates.
    - Keep components in app/Http/Livewire with clear, descriptive names.
    - Use Blade views in resources/views/livewire for UI pieces.
    - Let Livewire handle AJAX under the hood; avoid custom JS for this.
  ❌ Don’t:
    - Put presentation logic in PHP classes (keep them for state/data).
    - Duplicate features in Alpine that Livewire already handles better.
Example:
  class TaskList extends \Livewire\Component {
      public $tasks;
      public function render() {
          $this->tasks = Task::latest()->get();
          return view('livewire.task-list');
      }
  }
globs:
  - "app/Http/Livewire/**/*.php"
  - "resources/views/livewire/**/*.blade.php"
