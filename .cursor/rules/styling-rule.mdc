  üì± Responsive Design Rule
  ‚úÖ Do:
    - Use Tailwind breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:).
    - Make buttons/inputs touch-friendly (min 44px height).
    - Use w-full, max-w, object-cover for images; enable lazy loading.
    - Keep navigation adaptive (hamburger on mobile, full nav on desktop).
    - Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles for accessibility.
    - Test in Chrome DevTools and real devices.
  ‚ùå Don‚Äôt:
    - Hardcode pixel widths.
    - Hide important features on mobile.
    - Ignore accessibility (contrast, keyboard nav).
globs:
  - "resources/views/**/*.blade.php"
  - "resources/css/**/*.css"
