  🟦 Blade Rule
  ✅ Do:
    - Keep Blade focused on layout and rendering data.
    - Use components, @include, and @foreach for clean markup.
    - Store layouts in resources/views/layouts for reusability.
    - Keep logic minimal (business logic in controllers/Livewire).
  ❌ Don’t:
    - Write heavy PHP in Blade.
    - Mix business logic with presentation.
globs:
  - "resources/views/**/*.blade.php"
