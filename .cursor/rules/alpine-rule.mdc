  ⚡ Alpine.js Rule
  ✅ Do:
    - Use x-data, x-show, @click, x-model for small UI interactions.
    - Keep logic inline and minimal in Blade templates.
    - Use Alpine for instant client-side changes (e.g., modals, dropdowns).
  ❌ Don’t:
    - Replace Livewire with Alpine for heavy data tasks.
    - Write large JS blocks; keep Alpine lightweight.
Example:
  <div x-data="{ open: false }">
    <button @click="open = !open">Toggle</button>
    <div x-show="open">Hello!</div>
  </div>
globs:
  - "resources/views/**/*.blade.php"
alwaysApply: true
