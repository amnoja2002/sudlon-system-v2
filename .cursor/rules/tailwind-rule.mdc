  🎨 Tailwind Rule
  ✅ Do:
    - Use responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) for breakpoints.
    - Prefer utility classes over custom CSS.
    - Group classes logically (layout → spacing → colors → typography).
    - Extract reusable components when markup repeats.
  ❌ Don’t:
    - Overuse inline <style> or custom CSS.
    - Hardcode widths that break responsiveness.
globs:
  - "resources/css/**/*.css"
  - "resources/views/**/*.blade.php"
