  🏗️ Project Stack Overview
  This Laravel app uses:
  - Blade → for templating and rendering task lists and layouts.
  - Tailwind → for responsive, utility-first styling.
  - Alpine.js → for lightweight, inline interactivity (modals, dropdowns).
  - Livewire → for server-driven reactivity (tasks, forms, search, pagination).
  - Responsive Design → must look and work great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
globs:
  - "resources/views/**/*.blade.php"
  - "resources/css/**/*.css"
  - "app/Http/Livewire/**/*.php"
